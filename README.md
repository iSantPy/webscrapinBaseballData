Getting data from Venezuelan players in MLB history

Using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, I scraped data for all Venezuelan players from https://www.baseball-reference.com/. The main goal is to use this data to analyze and extract meaningful information to understand the stats for all Venezuelan players in MLB history.

Future projects can utilize this code to extract data for different nationalities and compare the contribution to the game by different countries.
